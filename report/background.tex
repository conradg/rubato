\chapter{Background}

In this chapter we cover the theory of adaptive learning, and look at some examples of existing websites that employ adaptive learning. We then look at the basics of Western music theory in terms of pitch, the 12-tone scale, and tuning. Finally, we look at autocorrelation, a method of detecting pitch.
	\section{Adaptive learning}
	Web based learning has been a topic of interest almost since the birth of the web\cite{alexander1995teaching}, and the introduction of the HTML5 standard has opened up even more opportunities for computers to play a role in the education process\cite{griffiths2012profile}. 3 notable examples of web based learning systems, a class of web application I refer to as a WLS, are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Coursera, a site that provides lecture material for various university level courses.
		\item  Codeacademy, a site designed to help people learn coding by getting them to undertake interactive browser based programming lessons.
		\item and Duolingo, a site designed to help the user learn foreign languages through interactive exercises that tries to tailor-make each exercise to the users needs by analysing their strengths/weaknesses.
	\end{itemize}
	The end aim of these sites is the same as all WLS's: to educate the user, but there are key differences between them which we can use to categorise them further into a hierarchy.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{static}: This facilitates learning through a pull model, with users viewing learning material on the site, and doing what they like with the information they are given. This only allows a one way interaction with no form of testing/feedback mechanism. Coursera is an example of a static WLS.
		\item \emph{dynamic}: These build on everything the static WLS has to offer, and include some sort of feedback loop, normally in the form of providing the user with tests/exercises they can use to improve their understanding of the learning materials provided to them. This allows a two way interaction that can help to cement understanding of concepts by allowing the user to put them into practice. Codeacademy is an example of a Dynamic WLS.
		\item \emph{adaptive}: These includes all the features of a dynamic WLS, only it can treat every user differently by analysing their strengths and weaknesses based on the exercises it supplies them with \cite{duolingoDataDriven}. This adaptive approach allows for superior teaching to static or dynamic WLS's, as if implemented correctly it will start to mimic the tailor-made learning experience one might receive from a real-world \bsq{for-hire} tutor. Duolingo is an example of an adaptive WLS.
	\end{itemize}

	
	\subsection{Adaptive learning in music}
		There are many ways that adaptive learning techniques can be applied in a musical context. As an example, imagine a simple exercise.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The user is played a rhythmical phrase.
			\item They must then replicate the phrase by tapping it in on the space bar. 
			\item The application then calculates how accurate the user's approximation of the rhythm is, and feeds this information back to the user
		\end{itemize}
		The application can offer the user simple rhythms to start off with, and then, as it notices the user repeat the rhythms with greater and greater accuracy, it can increase the difficulty by introducing syncopation, triplets, and other advanced musical techniques.
		

	\section{Existing Musicality Tutors}
	
	There are a wide variety of existing web-based applications that teach musicality, to varying degrees. There are programs to allow you to practice interval recognition\cite{intervalEarTrainer}, identify a note in a chord, practice recognition of rhythms\cite{rhythmTrainer}. A lot of these programs are standalone, and focussed on one specific area. Musictheory.net\cite{musicTheorynet} is a good example of a website that that goes beyond that, it provides exercises that test a wide variety of skills, trains your ear as well as providing music theory lessons. However Musictheory.net provides no adaption to the user, the furthest it goes is allowing you to specify what you want to be taught, but it is not intelligent enough to work it out itself.
	\section{Music Theory}
	In order to understand some of the workings of the program it will be necessary to delve briefly into a little music theory. We will examine the fundamentals of Western music theory, as well as theory of pitch. From here on we shall talk exclusively in terms of Western music theory, as it is the theory that the overwhelming majority of contemporary Western music is based upon.
	

	\subsection{Pitch}
	\par The fundamental quality of a note played on the piano, plucked on the guitar, or sung by the voice is its pitch. The other defining quality of a note is its timbre/tone i.e. whether it sounds harsh or mellow, buzzy or clean, but this is a quality that is very hard to quantify, and also not as important to the overall melody of a piece of music - The same melody played on a guitar and a piano can certainly be considered to be the same piece of music, despite the differing tones of the instruments, but if you change the pitch of any notes, it becomes a different melody entirely. So of an individual note in a melody, we can say that its pitch is its defining characteristic.
	
	\par What do we mean by pitch? Scientifically, the pitch value of an audio signal is determined by that signal's fundamental frequency, \f0, where a higher frequency corresponds to a higher pitch, and a lower frequency a low pitch, however in terms of human perception, it is not as concrete as this, as there are various different psychoacoustic phenomena that determine how \bsq{high} or \bsq{low} a given note sounds. For example, a sinusoidal tone played at the same frequency at a low volume followed by a high volume will appear to be playing two different pitches, with the louder tone sounding lower in pitch. However, sinusoidal tones are much simpler than the rich complex tones of a musical instrument, which due to being constructed of many different frequencies can provide the listener with more cues as to the pitch they are at, so for the purposes of this project we will define pitch as it is defined in most musical contexts, as a logarithmic function of frequency.	
	
	\par Some instruments like pianos and guitars have predetermined pitches that the instrumentalist can produce. Others, like the violin or human voice, can create any pitch within a given spectrum in a continuous fashion. These two classes of instrument are quite different in that the latter type requires a more precise ear to play so that they sound in tune.
	
	\subsubsection{The Scale}
	There are of course an infinite number of pitches, as there are infinitely many different frequencies that an audio signal can have. However, if you start from a base frequency and gradually increase the pitch, you will eventually find that the note \bsq{sounds the same} as the note you started on, only higher. This happens every time you double the frequency, a ratio called an \bsq{octave}, and is an interesting property of the ear. Thus in the range of an octave, you can find all the pitches you could possibly think of. For the purposes of making music though, these pitches are quantised into 12 different notes. They are recognisable on the musical keyboard as shown below. The \bsq{\#} and \bsq{b} characters denote a sharpening or flattening of a pitch, i.e. a raising or lowering of the pitch respectively.

	\subsubsection{Representing pitch}
	We now know about the 12 different notes in the Western scale, but as we have mentioned, simply knowing that a note's pitch is a \bsq{C} doesn't give us complete information about the note, as we are missing the octave information that tells us how high or low the note is. In this report, there are two main representations we will use.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Scientific notation} : This works on the basis that \bsq{middle C}, the C in the middle of a normal piano, is represented as C4. The next note above that is C\#4 or Db4, followed by D4 and so on until we reach B4, 11 semitones up. The next note after this is the C again, and since we have completed a full octave, we denote it C5. Similarly going downwards, the note directly below C4 is B3 etc. all the way down to C3, where the pattern repeats. This is arguably the most intuitive way of representing both a pitch and an octave as concisely as possible.
		\item \textbf{MIDI notation} :  This is the format used to store MIDI data, the most widely used music sequencing data format. It works on the principle that middle C is represented by the number 60, and incrementing and decrementing this number gives you the notes a semitone either side. This is convenient as it allows us handle the numerical side  of musical analysis with ease.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Tuning}
	Tuning defines the mapping between frequency and notes. Convention dictates that the A above middle C on a piano (A4 in scientific notation or 69 in MIDI) is tuned at 440Hz (this is where the 440 comes from in the equation above), and this is referred to as \bsq{tuning to A440}. In \bsq{Equal Temperament}, the tuning system found in most modern pianos, all notes are spaced equally, which means that you can play in any key and still produce the same sound. In equal temperament:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Doubling the frequency causes an increase in pitch of an octave, so A880 is the next A above A440.
		\item Since a leap of 12 semitones is caused by a doubling of the \f0 , it follows that the frequency ratio between each semitone (any two adjacent notes on the keyboard above) is \(2^\frac{1}{12}\) or about \(1.059\).
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Converting from frequency to pitch}
	
	For the purposes of this program it will often be necessary to convert between frequency and pitch. Using equal temperament and the MIDI notation, we can define a function thus.
	
		\[p=69+12\times {\log_2 \frac{f}{440Hz}}\] 
		
	where \(p\) is the pitch in MIDI notation, and \(f\) is the frequency.
	
	As mentioned previously in the section regarding the scale, there are only 12 different notes that are commonly used, yet this function can provide us with fractional values. What sense can we make of a number like 54.38? The unit most commonly used to represent fractions of a semitone is the cent. There are 100 cents in a semitone, so the number 54.38 would be translated to a F\#3 at 38 cents sharp, similarly, a score of 54.8 would be translated to a G that was 20 cents flat.
	
	\subsubsection{Intervals}
	An interval is the distance between two notes as measured by the ratio of their frequencies. We have discussed one interval already, that being the octave, who's frequency ratio is 2:1. The next simplest interval is the \bsq{perfect fifth}, who's frequencies have a ratio of 3:2. Now we run into a problem with equal temperament. While the perfectly spaced notes of the piano are useful for their flexibility with respect to what key you wish to play in, they cannot accurately represent the purest intervals such as the perfect fifth. The closest interval on the piano is 7 semitones, or a ratio of \(2^\frac{7}{12}\):1 = 1.4983. Thankfully however, this slight difference is not great enough to offend most peoples' ears.
	\par The nature of an interval is such that two intervals starting on different notes will have a similar sound. Taken out of any harmonic context, an interval of a perfect fifth starting on an A will have the exact same effect as one starting on a C, or F, or any other note. This is why if you play a piece in a different key to that which it was written (meaning all the notes are shifted down or all are shifted up from where they should be) you can still call it the same piece, and indeed it will still very recognisably be the same piece, as all of the intervals in the accompaniment and melody will be the same).
	\subsubsection{The importance of good intonation}
	\par For instrumentalists of the continuously pitched instruments mentioned above such as the violin and human voice, producing correctly tuned intervals is a vital skill known as \bsq{intonation}. Poor intonation can be the downfall of many a chamber choir, or ensemble, as one person singing wrong notes can lead half the group into another key which will sound very jarringly unpleasant. What's more, good sight reading depends on the ability to not only tune the intervals correctly, but to be able to recall what they sound like, and translate written music directly into performance in real time. Within the classical singing circuit, good sight reading is one of the most desirable, and rare, qualities in a singer, and a good sight reader can command high fees for their time.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{intervals.png}
		\caption{Any given melody can be thought of as a sequence of intervals}
	\end{figure}		
	
	\par Practising intonation is a useful exercise in and of itself however, even for pianists, guitarists and flautists, as a good command of intonation translates to a better musical ear, and can allow you to easily transcribe a melody through recognising the intervals it is comprised of, an exceedingly useful skill for any musician to have. However, there are very few tools to allow you to do, and it is normally only achievable by singing to a well musically trained peer and having them analyse you.
	
	\subsection{Human vocal range}
	Male and female voices can generally be split into 4 types which are determined by their singing range. They are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bass: E2-E4
		\item Tenor: C3-C5
		\item Alto: F3-F5
		\item Soprano: C4-C6
	\end{itemize}
	
	These values will be useful to us when it comes to writing our pitch detection function as they will determine the range of values we have to allow our detected frequency to fall in.
	
	\section{Pitch Detection}
	\par
	Pitch detection is a well understood problem that has been researched for many years. The pitch of a note, as described above, is the human perception of how high or low it is. The pitch value of an audio signal is determined by the fundamental frequency, \f0 of the signal, and thus the problem of pitch detection of a signal is analogous to finding that signal's fundamental frequency. 
	
	\subsection{Fundamental Frequency Detection Methods}
	
	\f0 detection is a difficult process, and there is no \bsq{best method} so to speak, each approach has its drawbacks and advantages, the normal trade-off being that a method that is fast may not be reliable and vice versa.
	There are two main approaches to \f0 detection, analysing the signal in the the time-domain, or the frequency domain. 
	\par
	To analyse in the frequency domain requires the use of the Fourier Transform, and is therefore a slower process, but provides more accuracy, as well as support for multiple notes being detected simultaneously. However, as we are only using monophonic pitch detection, and responsiveness is key, then for our purposes, time-domain algorithms will be the most appropriate.
	\begin{figure}[h!]
  		\caption{Time domain (above) vs frequency domain representations of the same signal, the Time domain representation plots amplitude against time, and is a quantisation of the raw audio signal. The second image represents the frequencies present in the audio signal, and shows their intensity on the y-axis}
  		\centering
    	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/time-frequency.png}
	\end{figure}

		\subsubsection{Autocorrelation}
		A standard method of time-domain \f0 detection is autocorrelation\cite{comparativePitchDetection}. It exploits the fact that a periodic or quasiperiodic waveform such as a sustained sung note will be self-similar by the definition of periodicity. If we compare a waveform with a copy of that waveform offset by the period of the waveform i.e. \(\f0 ^{-1}\) then we should expect to see a strong correlation between them. So autocorrelation works by iterating over all the possible offset values, and determining which one has the best correlation. This correlation value for each different offset is described by the equation below, where x is the signal function, N is the window size of the waveform you are considering, and v is the offset value.  \[R_x(v) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1-v} x[n]x[n+v]\]
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{autocorrelation.png}
			\caption{This lag value will have high autocorrelation}
		\end{figure}

		\subsubsection{Limitations}
		One fundamental limitation of Autocorrelation is that octave errors are frequently encountered. This occurs when the offset is calculated to be double what it should be, and is prone to happening as the nature of a periodic wave is such that if you shift it along twice the offset then you will also end up with a valid offset.
	
\section{Audio processing}
	An analog audio signal can be represented digitally as a series of "samples" These samples are quantised versions of the amplitude of the audio signal.
	\subsection{Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory}
	The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory states that to be able to represent a periodic signal with frequency B, we must sample at a rate at least twice that of B. In terms of our pitch detection, the highest frequency we should need to measure will be no higher than 1000Hz, requiring a sampling rate of 2000Hz. Since most microphone capture audio at 44.1KHz or more, then we will have a more than adequate sampling rate.
	\subsection{Pulse Code Modulation}
	Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is the most common format of storing uncompressed digital audio data, and is an array of quantised samples. In our application, we are using 32 bit PCM, where each sample of audio is represented as a 32 Bit Floats between -1 and 1.
